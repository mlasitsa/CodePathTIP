Problem 3: Encode
The Riddler is planning to leave a coded message to lead Batman into a trap. Write a function shuffle() that takes in a string, the Riddler's message, and encodes it using an integer array indices. The message will be shuffled such that the character at the ith position in message moves to index indices[i] in the shuffled string. You may assume len(message) is equal to the len(indices).

def shuffle(message, indices):
	pass
Example Usage:

message = "evil"
indices = [3, 1, 2, 0]
shuffle(message, indices)

message = "findme"
indices = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
shuffle(message, indices)
Example Output:

"lvie"
"findme"

def shuffle(message, indices):
    shuffled = ""
    for i in range(len(indices)):
        shuffled += message[indices.index(i)]
    return shuffled

message = "good"
indices = [3, 1, 2, 0]
print(shuffle(message, indices)) # "dogo"
message = "findme"
indices = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(shuffle(message, indices))
